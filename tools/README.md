# Kanban
The [Open Practice Library](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/kanban/) defines Kanban as:

> ...a framework used to implement agile software development based in the following practices:
> 
> * Visualize the workflow
> * Limit Work in Progress (WIP)
> * Manage flow
> * Make Process Policies Explicit
> * Feedback loops

Trello is a great free tool for getting familiar with Kanban boards and concepts such as:

* [Writing Simple User Stories](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/story-kick-offs/)
* [Story Pointing/Point Poker](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/story-repointing/)
* Stack Racking
* [WIP Limits](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/limit-work-in-progress/)
* [Definition of Ready](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/definition-of-ready/)
* [Definition of Done](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/definition-of-done/)
