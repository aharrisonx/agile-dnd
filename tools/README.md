# Tools
A collection of tools that can be used for Agile D&D

## D&D Tools

### [D&D Beyond](https://dndbeyond.com)
D&D Beyond is an official toolset that makes playing Dungeons & Dragons easy for beginners. You can access the basic rules of the game for free, create a character in minutes and play them using digital dice from your browser or mobile device, and manage your campaign! You can even purchase official D&D books in the marketplace to level up your game experience!
### [Owlbear Rodeo](https://owlbear.rodeo)
Owlbear Rodeo is an attempt to make a web app to run tabletop encounters without the complicated setup process needed for other Virtual Table Tops (VTTs).
Made by two people in Melbourne, Australia. Mitch and Nicola were looking for an easy way to continue their d&d campaign as in-person interaction becomes harder during the COVID-19 crisis.
### [Roll 20](https://roll20.net)
The Roll20 team is dedicated to enabling gamers to unite across any distance via their easy-to-use gaming tools. They strive to lessen the technical burden on the participants, facilitate the formation of new gaming groups, and to make barriers to entry as few as possible when gathering around a table for camaraderie. To accomplish these goals they seek to create a service that is sustainable and will be a resource to the gaming community as long as it is needed.

### [Discord](https://discord.com)
Discord is a voice, video and text communication service used by over a hundred million people to hang out and talk with their friends and communities.  You can create your own server, public and private text, voice, and video channels, and incorporate bots to facilitate dice rolling, background music, and more!
## Agile Tools
### Social Contract
The Social Contract is a simple and effective way to enable team autonomy and self accountability for engagements. The Social Contract or Agreement is created by and for the team. It looks to codify the behaviors and expectations of the team. It also provides a mechanism for the team to radiate and share its desired behaviours with management and other stakeholders.
