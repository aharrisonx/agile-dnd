# Tools
A collection of tools that can be used for Agile D&D

# Social Contract
The Social Contract is a simple and effective way to enable team autonomy and self accountability for engagements. The Social Contract or Agreement is created by and for the team. It looks to codify the behaviors and expectations of the team. It also provides a mechanism for the team to radiate and share its desired behaviours with management and other stakeholders.
# Kanban
The [Open Practice Library](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/kanban/) defines Kanban as:

> ...a framework used to implement agile software development based in the following practices:
> 
> * Visualize the workflow
> * Limit Work in Progress (WIP)
> * Manage flow
> * Make Process Policies Explicit
> * Feedback loops

Trello is a great free tool for getting familiar with Kanban boards and concepts such as:

* [Writing Simple User Stories](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/story-kick-offs/)
