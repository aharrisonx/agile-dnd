# The Basics
Don't let the names fool you, the classic 4-person party of Fighter, Cleric, Rogue, Wizard can be adapted to almost any adventure and any group of players.  The rich depth of sub-classes (specializations within each class) allows players to take these "basic" templates and create unique, personally valuable characters that will allow players to make meaningful connections with their fellow adventurers!

## Fighter
The [Fighter](characters/fighter.pdf) class traditionally focuses on strength and dexterity. Although those are very important aspects of the Fighter, they are more than just a sword, shield, and armor. In addition to all of the weapons and martial training, Fighters have courage, ingenuity, loyalty, compassion, and purpose.  You'll find fighters in every aspect of your business. The person who is out there, speaking up first, being the "tip of the spear"? That's your Fighter.

## Cleric
The [Cleric](characters/cleric.pdf) class is traditionally the healer in the party.  Clerics are also servant leaders, mentors, counselors, and teachers. Though the game lore paints them as acolytes/priests/religious figures, you don't have to bring religion into your game at all to employ/play clerics.  The ability to do fantastical things (such as magically heal someone) can come from whatever means fits your group's style.

## Rogue
The [Rogue](characters/rogue.pdf) class relies on persuasion, trust, sleight of hand, and skill. Rogues are broadly skilled and choose expertise in a select few disciplines. Rogues are also architects, negotiators, buyers, and sellers.  The traditional stereotype of "Thief" should not apply in this instance, and while there are several sub classes that focus on the illegal/immoral options for Rogues, there are just as many that do not.  Mastermind, Arcane Trickster, Scout, and Swashbuckler are all examples of this.

## Wizard
The [Wizard](characters/wizard.pdf) class is the most diverse, and the most complicated of the 4 basic classes.  Wizards are able to control the elements of magic through rigorous study and training.  Wizards are also scholars, professors, inventors, creators, and engineers.  They have dedicated years of their lives to education, and the pursuit of arcane knowledge.  As Arthur C. Clarke famously wrote, ["Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."](https://lab.cccb.org/en/arthur-c-clarke-any-sufficiently-advanced-technology-is-indistinguishable-from-magic/#:~:text=In%201962%2C%20in%20his%20book,technology%20is%20indistinguishable%20from%20magic%E2%80%9D.)  Wizards are the living embodiment of that statement.
