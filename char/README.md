# Character Creation
Creating the characters for the session will be the most challenging part for you as a GM. Scheduling a 30-45 minute 1:1 session with each player should be enough to get the basic idea for a character down.  In this time, you'll need to cover the following topics:

 - An overview of what a tabletop RPG is and what it is not
 - Time committment and participation expectations
 - Discover what the player wants to get out of the game
 - Determine the type of character they want to play

## Tabletop RPG Overview <a name="overview"></a>
What is a Tabletop Role Playing Game (TTRPG)?  At the heart of it, a TTRPG is a form of role-playing game (RPG) in which participants engage in collective storytelling guided by a specially designated player typically called the game master (GM).  The GM describes the game world and its inhabitants; the other players describe the intended actions of their characters, and the GM describes the outcomes. Some outcomes are determined by the game system, and some are chosen by the GM.

In Agile D&D, the story is told by a group of disparate, but highly-skilled operators brought together to accomplish a specific common goal that will benefit them all. Sounds a lot like a scrum team, doesn't it?

## Time Committment and Participation Expectations <a name="time-part"></a>
Each player should be committed to dedicating 30-60 minutes in a 1:1 session with the GM to create their character and an additional 2-4 hours per game session.  This time should be explicitly carved out of the work day by management and made very clear that participants are free to engage without fear of their "day job" being in jeopardy.
