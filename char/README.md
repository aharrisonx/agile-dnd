# Character Creation
Creating the characters for the session will be the most challenging part for you as a GM. Scheduling a 30-45 minute 1:1 session with each player should be enough to get the basic idea for a character down.  In this time, you'll need to cover the following topics:

 - An overview of what a tabletop RPG is and what it is not
 - Time committment and participation expectations
 - Discover what the player wants to get out of the game
 - Determine the type of character they want to play
