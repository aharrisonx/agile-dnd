## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
Agile D&D is a set of practices and concepts for teaching and reinforcing Agile methodologies by using D&D (or any Table Top Role Playing Game) as a framework.  At its core, Agile is a simple and ingenious concept providing continuous incremental improvement (Leveling Up) through small and frequent releases (Adventures). In this framework, we can teach concepts like:

* Kanban
* Scrum
* CI/CD
* DevSecOps
* Backlog creation & Grooming
* The Sprint
* Sprint Planning
* Sprint Review
* Sprint Retrospectives

## How It Works <a name="howitworks"></a>
Play D&D. Learn Agile. Profit.

### We're Just Playing Games? <a name="justgames"></a>
Yes. You're "JUST" playing games.  Let's dig in to that sentence for a second.  Games have been at the center of human learning since the beginning. As infants, our parents play games with us like peekaboo so that our brains can start understanding concepts like object permanence.  Pattycake teaches us hand-eye coordination and rhythm. As we grow older and are able to move around and communicate on our own, we start engaging in play with others. Social constructs and behaviors are learned and reinforced through games and play.  Almost all of the fundamental learning that we all carry with us was acquired through games. The same can be true for learning and reinforcing any new content, and THAT is what we are tapping into with Agile D&D.

The game itself is a means to an end. There doesn't need to be (and in actuality, there should NOT be) any direct connection between the content or plot of the game and learning Agile processes. The learning comes by engaging in the same TYPES of activities as Agile practices like creating effective user stories, Sprint planning, story pointing, and many more.

## Business Value <a name="busval"></a>
### How does all this game playing benefit my business?

The concepts of team cohesion, trust, and a sense of shared purpose having a direct and tangible positive impact on a business' profits have been widely researched and documented. Agile D&D will give your business/organization/team a powerful toolset for creating meaningful, lasting, trust-based relationships both inside the organization and with external customers, vendors, and stakeholders.
